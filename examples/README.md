# _Note on Code Examples_

Many (_most?_) of the Examples in this `/examples` dir
are either derived/adapted from or directly "_borrowed_"
from the _fantastic_ book:
Programming Elixir 1.3 by the _brilliant_ Dave Thomas! @pragdave

> If you are learning Elixir from scratch the @dwyl tutorial will
only get you through your **_first_ hour**.

If you decide to _embrace_ Elixir
for your next personal or _client_
project we **_highly_ recommend** that you
**_immidiately_ purchase** Dave's _excellent_ book!
It is the _single_ best place/way to learn Elixir.
The book is _really_ well written, by a _seasoned_ technical writer
and has superb editorial "_coherence_"
from the great people of @pragprog.com

We have **_purchased_ several physical copies** of the Book for DWYL
these are being used by team members as reference guides.

If you are a _remote_ learner/team member and would like a _physical_
("hard") copy of the book please show your interest on
the issue on GitHub: https://github.com/dwyl/learn-elixir/issues/11

We will _mail_ a ***free*** (_paid for by DWYL_) copy of the book
to _any_ address in the world! Just get in touch!

Yes, we _know_ that Google has a _list_ of where you can download
the eBook _without_ paying for it:
https://www.google.com/search?q=Programming%20Elixir%201.3%20pdf

But we _strongly urge_ anyone who wants to _use_ Elixir in any
(_professional_) capacity to ***pay*** for the
(_~~hundreds~~ thousands of hours_) hard work Dave Thomas
and the "Prag Prog" team have put
into _crafting_ this superb learning resource!!

If you do _any_ work in Elixir the price of the book will be paid for
in the first couple of hours of work!
If you _want_ to do any ***paid*** work in Elixir
just look at the DWYL backlog and you can get paid
for your knowledge/skills/contributions ***immediately***!

_Happy Elixir Leaning Everyone_! :droplet: :heart: :white_check_mark: :rocket:
